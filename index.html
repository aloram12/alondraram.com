  <!-- Welcome Message -->
  <p>Hi, My Name is Alondra and I was born and raised here in Washington State :) I've gone to Green River College before attending University of Washington and plan to eventually leave this state after finding a stable job. Originally, I wanted to work as a Veterinarian but I changed career paths after re-evaluating my life goals and financial goals. <br> 
  My main mission now is to gain as much experience and exposure to working in the tech field and apply myself to new situations whenever possible.</p>

  <h4>Project Name:</h4>
  <p id="internship-project-name">Wild Bird Emergency Calls</p>
  <h4>Date:</h4>
  <p id="internship-date">Summer 2024</p>
  <h4>Background:</h4>
  <p id="internship-background">Puget Sound Wildcare Rehabilitation Center wanted to collect a substantial amount of data on how many emergency bird calls were recieved and referred to other facilities in the state. The issue is that they did not have the proper license to handle wild birds, and other facilities were hours away from caller locations meaning the wild bird in danger would not recieve care. All data collected would go towards proving the facilities importance in King and Pierce county.</p>
  <h4>Issue:</h4>
  <p id="internship-issue">Data retrieval, collection, and sanitization for future legal representation</p>
  <h4>Role:</h4>
  <p id="internship-role">Data Intern + Animal Care Intern</p>
  <h4>Solution:</h4>
  <p id="internship-solution">Used existing data collection methods and improved them to more efficiently collect data</p>
  <h4>Process:</h4>
  <p id="internship-process">Report weekly to head facility director about collected calls, learn about wild bird laws and regulations, perform routine follow up calls from recent Emergency calls</p>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p id="internship-summary">This was a really fun internship where I got to learn so much about the wild animals that live with us here in the evergreen state. I was able to handle racoons, rabbits, squirrels, mice, and pigeons. I learned valuable information about data handling and how to carefully correct them for future data retrieval purposes.</p>

  <!-- Paragraph -->
  <p>
    Hi! I’m deeply passionate about optimizing systems and creating thoughtful designs, whether it’s tweaking CSS for a coding project, brainstorming resourceful strategies for clients, or crafting interactive tools like workout trackers and financial planners using Google Sheets. I love finding ways to make processes simpler and more efficient without sacrificing creativity.<br>
    <br>

    What sets me apart is my ability to bring creativity into every challenge, whether I’m working solo or in a team. I take pride in staying determined even when I’m unsure about a situation—my mindset pushes me to keep improving. Beyond work, I’m inspired by exploring cozy cafes, capturing the beauty of insects and animals through photography, and immersing myself in the energy of music festivals. (Atarashii Gakko in Seattle was a recent favorite!)<br>
    <br>
    In life, I’m motivated by the idea of being better than I was yesterday. One of my biggest personal goals? Mastering a fighting game,competing in an e-sports competition, and winning. Every day, I try to balance my drive for self-improvement with my love for creative discovery, and it’s been an interesting journey so far. </p>
